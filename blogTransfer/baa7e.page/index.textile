[v001](http://001.vade.info/) is a simple and elegant framework for
building modular and reusable performance patches for Max/MSP and Jitter

The lowest level patches in v.001 are abstractions that encapsulate the
funcionality of the most commonly used Max/MSP GUI objects (and
associated helper patches), rolled into one easy to use bpatcher system
of GUI widgets that can be redefined dynamically in performance.

The higher level v.001 framework integrates the functionality to even
higher levels of abstraction and ease of use.

v.001 also includes an open source realtime video performance
application written in Max/MSP and Jitter, using the v.001 framework and
modules (not yet available).

v001 is developed by Anton Marini (aka Vade) and licensed as Creative
