Last week I did a lecture and worksop for the Musikkteknologi students
at NTNU in Trondheim. Wednesday I did a presentation of artistic work
and discussed experience and reflection on them. Thursday I did two
4-hour workshops providing an introduction to spatialisation.\
\
For the workshop Jamoma was used for rapid prototyping, and we found
time to look into, test and listen to VBAP, ambisonics and DBAP.
Unfortunately no time for ViMiC or the HoloSpat bridge.\
