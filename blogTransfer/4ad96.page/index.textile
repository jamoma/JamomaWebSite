[aMente](http://faculty.roosevelt.edu/malone/ru/downloads.htm) by prof.
Don Malone is an algorithmic generator, a compositional tool in the
studio, can be played in real time like an instrument, and works by
applying various patterns to musical parameters (Rhythm - Pitch -
Velocity - Duration - Voice). The player controlls the patterns. The
patterns may be preconstructed themes or various serial and chaotic
processes. aMente is useful as a composition tool or performance
instrument. Manipulate a theme, range or set in real time, improvising
with theories.
