We're glad to announce Jamoma 0.5 Release Candidate 1, which is
available [online](http://www.jamoma.org/download.html) .

Jamoma 0.5 is a major rewrite for Max 5, and also contains numerous
improvements and new features.

The Jamoma developers have been working hard lately to improve Jamoma,
and to fix as many bugs as possible. However, some bugs may still have
survived our testings, and we would appreciate your help to catch and
report them before we announce the final release.

We have set up a new project development site, and we would appreciate
your registration under: \

It's a good place to keep in touch with the Jamoma developers and to
report bugs and feature requests, so everybody's welcome !

The most important changes have been listed in the
[ChangeLog](http://redmine.jamoma.org/wiki/modular/Change_Log), and
there is also a
[guideline](http://redmine.jamoma.org/wiki/modular/Jamoma_05) to port
your modules from Jamoma 0.4 to 0.5. Though, even if you have been using
the 0.5 betas, you'll need to change a few things, which are copied at
the end of the guideline page.

We hope you'll enjoy Jamoma 0.5, and we hope to get some valuable
feedback.
