During the Jamoma development workshop last week, the development team
got invited to the [Matralab](http://matralab.hexagram.ca/) at Concordia
University in Montr√©al directed by [Sandeep
Bhagwati](http://matralab.hexagram.ca/matrapeople/sandeep-bhagwati) who
holds the Canada Research Chair for Inter-X Art. \
In his work, Sandeep explores the artistic world between composed,
predetermined structures and free improvisation. An approach which he
calls "comprovisation". \
We discussed how Jamoma together with the
[Virage](http://www.plateforme-virage.org/) sequencer could be used for
comprovisation. We also listened to some spatialization work by [Navid
Navab](http://matralab.hexagram.ca/matrapeople/navid-navab) which was
carried out with the help of Jamoma. \
It is always exciting to see (and hear) how Jamoma get used. \
