Some time ago, Adrian Gierakowski [shared a nice
patch](http://jamoma-forums-mailing-lists.3076123.n2.nabble.com/mixing-presets-tp5563868p5668098.html)
showing use of a new jcom.hub feature to mix between presets.

Today, Adrian just [posted a message on the Jamoma User
forum](http://jamoma-forums-mailing-lists.3076123.n2.nabble.com/collection-of-jamoma-modules-for-granular-sound-processing-written-using-FTM-Gabor-tp5954121p5954121.html)
to annouce some of his modules are now public. This "ag.granular.suite"
collection contains a number of
[FTM/Gabor](http://ftm.ircam.fr/index.php/Main_Page)-based modules for
granulation processes and control. Be sure to watch Adrian's video
inserted below to have an overview of the nice features his modules
have.

It is really nice to know about people's use of Jamoma. If you would
like to have some of your modules available in the User Library or
featured on this blog, please get in touch with us thru the
