Today[Alexander](http://www.arj.no) added a great feature to the
jmod.motiongram% module providing a nice option both for creative and
analysis use.

Watch the movie to see how easy it is to do slit-scanning with Jamoma

\
\
This feature will be available in the next Jamoma Modular update. You
can also see the
