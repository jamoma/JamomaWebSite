There seems to be several similar initiatives to Jamoma happening at the
moment. The [UBC Max/MSP/Jitter
Toolbox](http://www.opusonemusic.net/muset/toolbox.html) blogged here a
few days ago is one of them. Yesterday I discovered another:
[Framework](http://www.leafcutter.33-rpm.net/Downloadframework.htm) by
Leafcutter John. Framework is aimed at effect processing of stereo audio
signals. This is how he describes it:

*I wanted to do a project where the many people could contribute to a
big Max patch for treating audio. So I developed Framework, a free to
use / modify modular audio patch made in Max/MSP.*

*The framework part of the patch comprises 9 bpatcher objects connected
in series. The user loads different kind of audio treatment modules into
the bpatchers.*

*You play a stereo file into the framework using splay\~\~. Or you can
use a mic input. If you want to do something different to this then
please hack the patch!*

He encourage others to make new modules and e-mail them to him for
inclusin in future releases.
