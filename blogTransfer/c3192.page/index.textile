For a while we have been airing the idea of doing development sprints:
Focused efforts over a limited period of time targeting specific goals
for Jamoma.

Jamoma dataspace
----------------

For the last week Trond Lossius has done a lot of work on merging the
pitch and time dataspaces, as well as writing up unit tests for
dataspaces. He has set this development effort as a (minor)
[milestone](http://redmine.jamoma.org/projects/foundation/versions/19).

Hopefully these development sprints will help a lot to get some specific
areas more stable or featured and will ease the release of Jamoma
updates. If you want to come and help Trond finishing this effort, just
get in touch thru the [forum](http://jamoma.org/forum.html).
