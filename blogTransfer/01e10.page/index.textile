Module Bug Fixes:\

- fixed init problems in jmod.mouse\
- mapper.mod: fixed bug where the algorithm would not be\
 created in the mapping if the ui of the module was used\
 to create it\
- updates to jmod.equalizer\~ and jmod.multidelay\~ to \
 bring them up to date with the new core. \
 (jmod.equalizer\~ is still not ready for use though)\
- jmod.limiter\~ and jmod.saturation\~ now directly use an \
 external for their algorithms\
- added /preamp and /mode parameters to \
 jmod.saturation\
