Today saw some further work on the TextMate bundle discussed
[yesterday](/groups/jamoma/weblog/21170/TextMate_bundle_for_cue_scripts.html),
and an updated zip file will be posted shortly to the blog post from
yesterday. I've also made a screen cast demoing it, and uploaded to
Vimeo.

While at it, I created a Jamoma channel at Vimeo. I hope this will be
useful for instruction videos as well as videos showcasing Jamoma in
use. Please subscribe to the channel, and if you have videos relating to
Jamoma, feel free to add them to the channel.
