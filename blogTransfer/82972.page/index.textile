Here's a sneak peek of the newest feature added to Jamoma: Support for
dataspaces.
\
\
In this example the parameter myPos is used to keep track of the
position of a point in space. The parameter is using the position
dataspace. By default position will be described using Cartesian
coordinates (xyz), but spherical coordinates (add) can be used as an
alternative way of describing position.
\
When ramping, the ramp will happen according to the dataspace used to
describe the target value. This way the point can move along straight
lines as well as e.g. perform spiraling movements.
