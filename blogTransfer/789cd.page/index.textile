Jamoma 0.4.6. was uploaded a few days ago. It's mainly a maintenance
release, and offers quite a few bug fixes as compared to 0.4.5.

Change log can be found [here](http://www.jamoma.org/wiki/ChangeLog).

This might be the last Max 4.6 compatible release of Jamoma. Current
development is now geared towards providing Max 5 compatibility, and we
hope to have that ready sometime the comming summer.
