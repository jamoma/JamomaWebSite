Irin is online again after a hiatus (available at
[http://www.carloscaires.com/](http://www.carloscaires.com/) ). I saw a
demo given by Horracio Vaggione at the June in Buffalo festival a couple
of years ago. What I remember most about it is that it seemed to have a
really good timeline interface. Horracio spoke extremely highly of the
environment in serveral conversations I had with him.\

Irin definitely has a fixed application (unlike Jamoma), but I beleive
it does what it is designed to do very well.\
