I'm currently in the middle of updating the web pages, so that
jamoma.org can have its own look and feel instead of inheriting the look
of the BEK intranet. There's a few issues about integration of Zope and
Plone still to be sorted out, and consequencially the WIKI is not
loading properly at the moment. I've posted a temporary copy of the wiki
[here](http://www.bek.no/Members/lossius/jamoma_wiki). The copy will be
removed once everything works properly again, hopefully by the end of
the week
