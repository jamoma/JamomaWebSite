Tim yesterday moved the Jamoma repository from CVS to
[Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/). We have updated the [Jamoma
wiki](../wiki) to reflect the current changes.

One of many advantages of using Subversion is that you can now get
(checkout) Jamoma from the repository with no username/password
required.
