[Moviestar](http://moviestar.marieke.nu/) is an interactive installation
by Marieke Verbiesen & Neeltje Sprengers.

The installation moulds old and new media together in order to create a
reallife moving filmset. Classic 16mm film, animation, robotics, sound
and motion-tracking are used to simulate a real life film set where
visitors play the main role.

A miniature robotic film set forms the background for the movie, while
interactive animations come are activated once a visitor enters the film
set.

In front of a green screen on the other side of the space, the visitors
movements are tracked in real time, both sound and image respond their
movements. Projected into a world that consists of monsters, UFOÂ´s and
other slightly surreal events, visitors can control animations by by
moving in front of the camera. Jamoma,
[cv.jit](http://www.iamas.ac.jp/%7Ejovan02/cv/) and
[FTM](http://ftm.ircam.fr) were used for live video analysis, processing
and control.\

Moviestar was presented at Filmhuis Den Haag September - October 2009.\
