Release candidate 10 for Jamoma 0.5 is now available for download. Mac
only so far, but hopefully the Windows installer will be up later today.
Enjoy, and please [report any
problems](http://redmine.jamoma.org/projects/modular/issues) you might
find.\
\
With this version we have officially dropped support for PPC processors
on Mac.\
