The move to [OpenSoundControl](http://www.opensoundcontrol.org) is now
complete. [Alexander Refsum Jensenius](http://www.arj.no/blog) has been
adding several new video modules in the last few days. We probably still
have some work to do before v.0.3.0 can be released, but I've decided to
upload a [preview](http://www.jamoma.org).

There are several reasons for this. The most important is that the port
to OSC implies some important changes in how to use Jamoma and how
modules have to be created, and if anyone lese is using it at the
moment, they might just as well adapt to the new way of doing it the
sooner the better.

I also believe the new version to be fairly reliable and stable, at
least on the Mac SOX plattform. I used the new OSC-compatible version
for all of the Tracker tour: 19 concert in two weeks. I didn't have any
issues with Jamoma or Max in general during the tour.
