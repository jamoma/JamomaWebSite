The first pre-release of Jamoma (version 0.2 alpha 1) is now available
for download form the front page. We have not yet made proper
installers, but installing should be as easy as downloading the Mac OSX
or Windows XP version, unpack and copy or move to the Cycling'74 folder.

In addition you might want to look for the jmod.meter\~ external and
copy that to the max-startup folder.
