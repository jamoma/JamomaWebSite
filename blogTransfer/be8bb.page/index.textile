Last week was the Teatrix workshop host by BEK, as previously mentioned
in this blog. We used Jamoma extensively in the workshop, and also took
the opporunity to a bit of development on it. The following pictures are
from the theater at USF Verftet where the Teatrix workshop was held.

Time for relaxing, discussion, and eating in the cafe overlooking the
harbor at USF Verftet.
