We didn't have time to properly finish up a real release of version
0.3.0 before Easter, so I've posted a second preview version of Jamoma
0.3.0 to the website. This is from a snapshot taken earlier today. It
should be quite good. We will be trying to wrap up the 0.3.0 release
over the next couple of weeks.
