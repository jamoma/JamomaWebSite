Over the past spring we have done major under-the-hood changes to how
C++ projects are maintained in Jamoma. Instead of needing to maintain
parallel Xcode and Visual Studio projects (and potential additional
projects for iOS and Linux), we now maintin project using simple YAML
text files.\
\
Tim has just posted on how this is done [on his
blog](http://74objects.com/2012/07/25/inventing-a-new-project-format/).
It is well worth a read, for Jamoma developers as well as others that
might be looking for a simple cross-platform project maintenance
solution.
