[GMEA](http://www.gmea.net) is holding a 4 day workshop on Jamoma, set
up by Pascal Baltazar. We'll try to blog what happens as it happens.

The first day of the workshop starts of with a presentation by Tim
Place, discussing general philosophy of Jamoma, how it has evolved, and
the modular structure of layers of complexity, from the C++ layer used
for externals, including the ttblue framework, via components,
algorithms, modules to a not existing top layer providing a framwork
hosting Jamoma modules.
