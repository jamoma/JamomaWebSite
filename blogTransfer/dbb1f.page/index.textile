[jamoma.org](http://www.jamoma.org) is now up and running. The site is
hosted by [BEK](http://www.bek.no). The site might look dull at the
moment, mainly inheriting standard intranet layout solutions from BEK,
but hopefully this will gradually be customized. The BEK servers offers
a number of powerful services for us to take advantage of, including
plone, zope, various streaming possibilities, blog, wiki, CVS, mailing
lists, tracker, chat, etc. etc.
