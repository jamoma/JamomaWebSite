For the past 10 years the Granular Toolkit (GTK) by Nathan Wolek has
been a welcome and much used extension to MaxMSP for granular synthesis
and processing.

[Nathan Wolek has just
announced](http://www.lowkeydigitalstudio.com/2011/08/gtk-10-years/)
that in order to ensure future usability as well as enable the code to
be used in other hosting environments, he has decided to end development
of GTK in its current form, and instead reimplement as new granular
components in Jamoma.

The source code for the externals in GTK will be open-surced under a BSD
license, so that it remains possible to maintain the current code for
projects that depends on it.

This is exciting news for Jamoma, and will certainly boost the feature
sets and useability of the DSP and AudioGraph libraries. With the recent
open-sourcing and inclusion of Plugtastic (wrapping AudioGraph externals
into Audio Unit plugins), it also opens up exciting possibilities for
creating granulation plugins in the future.
