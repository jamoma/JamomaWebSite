bq. For some reasons (i.e. installing an older version of Jamoma Modular), if you ever needed to uninstall Jamoma Modular, you will find in the disk image a shell script to automate the process of removing all installed Jamoma files.

h3. Setting up Max 5 preferences

Jamoma modules are based on UI objects which default appearance need to be set. To do so, launch Max 5 and go to the %(samp)Object Defaults% window, found in the %(samp)Options% menu.
