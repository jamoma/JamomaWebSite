h2. How to contribute?

If you are a programmer and want to join the Jamoma team, please get in touch with us at the <a href="http://jamoma.org/forum.html">development mailing list</a> or contact us directly <a href="mailto:jamoma@jamoma.org">off-list</a>. At current we are particularly interested in getting in touch with anyone willing to contribute towards the following development efforts: 

* Building Jamoma for Windows
* DSP and AudioGraph development
* True MVC ("model-view-controller":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) separation for Jamoma 0.6. In particular we will appreciate assistance with porting existing modules and components
* Documentation:
** Tutorials for Jamoma Modular
** Doxygen documentation of Jamoma Core. This is a great way to get to know the C++ frameworks
* Adapting Jamoma Core for use with iOS and OpenFrameworks

And of course, if you have other ideas and suggestions, we are all ears.
