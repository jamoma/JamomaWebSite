h2. OSC communication

Communication within and between Jamoma modules is based on the OSC protocol. As such, it also offers the possibility to communicate with other OSC-compatible softwares such as Pure Data, Reaktor, Isadora, EyesWeb or the Virage sequencer to name a few. Of course, controlling modules with Midi devices is also possible using the dedicated conversion and mapping modules.

This brings to your modules a convenient and consistent access to presets management, help patch and reference page, as well as basic parameters control such as gain, bypass or preview by the mean of optional widgets.

h2. Time is precious

Thus, Jamoma Modular offers a number of patch templates, shortcuts and tools to create and defines parameters that will come handy during the whole development process. Finally, Jamoma framework embed a full system to automagically create consistent module documentation.
