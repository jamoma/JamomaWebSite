Jamoma source codes are maintained using "Git":http://git-scm.com/ "version control system":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control and can be downloaded freely from the public "Github":http://www.github.com repository where they are hosted. In order to get Jamoma source code on your computer, first make sure you have Git installed and set up.

bq. As the name suggests it, please note that development version is not for prime use and may contains some bugs being worked on.

h3. Getting Git under OSX

Git package for OSX can be downloaded from Google Code. First visit the "Google Code site":http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/ %(seq)1%, then download the desired version from the right bar section of the page %(seq)2%.

Open the freshly downloaded disk image (.dmg) which should reside in your download folder (by default), then launch the installer by double-clicking the Git package.

Follow the various steps of the installer.

You now have Git installed on your computer !

bq. If you plan to use Git with a GUI client rather than from Terminal, you need to run the shell script provided in the disk image.

h3. Getting Git under Windows

Not yet available. Please ask for help on Jamoma forum.

h3. Cloning Jamoma repository

From "Github project page":http://github.com/jamoma/jamoma %(seq)1%, first copy the read-only sources "URL.":http://github.com/jamoma/Jamoma.git %(seq)2%.

Open a new Terminal window (Mac OSX) or Cygwin window (Windows) and run the following command asking Git to clone the repository corresponding to the address:

bc. git clone http://github.com/jamoma/Jamoma.git

You should see various informations printed to the Terminal window as illustrated below. Wait until it is done.

When done, go to the _Tools_ folder situated in the freshly created _Jamoma_ folder by typing in the Terminal window: @cd Jamoma/Tools@.

The only thing left to do in order to have the whole Jamoma repository downloaded is then to run the ruby @update.rb@ script. To do so, type in the Terminal window @ruby update.rb@ and hit the return key.

This Ruby script will clone and update to the latest version all Git submodules corresponding to the various branches of Jamoma development. Again, you should see quite a lot of informations printed to the Terminal window. When done, the whole Jamoma project should be properly copied on your computer.

h3. Building Jamoma framework and externals

Another Ruby script is provided to automate the building of all framework and Max externals. Assuming your are still running your Terminal session from the _Tools_ folder, execute the provided script by typing @ruby build.rb Development clean@ and hitting %(kbd)return%. The script will compile every component needed and copy them to their appropriate place.

Wait until the whole process is done. Please note that this can take quite a while.

bq. On your daily workflow, you will likely want to run the Ruby script @all.rb@ found in the _Tools_ folder which take care of running both the @update.rb@ and @build.rb@ scripts.

h3. Setting Max preferences

Launch Max 5 and in the %(samp)Options% menu %(seq)1% choose the %(samp)File Preferences% item %(seq)2%.

Then, in the File Preferences window, add the following folder to Max 5 search path :

- @~/Jamoma/builds/MaxMSP@

- @~/Jamoma/Modules/Dependencies/Max/Mac@ resp. @/Jamoma/Modules/Dependencies/Max/WinXP@
- @~/Jamoma/UserLib@

Max 5 objects default appearance also need to be set up so all Jamoma modules are displayed as expected. From Max 5 %(samp)Options% menu %(seq)1%, choose the %(samp)Object Defaults% item %(seq)2%

!images/Max_pref_setup_2.png!

In the %(samp)Object Defaults% window, click the %(samp)Load Settings% button in the lower-left corner of the window %(seq)1%. Then, from the popup menu, select %(samp)JamomaMax% %(seq)2% so all Jamoma modules will be displayed as expected.

Max is now properly set up for Jamoma. Have fun "exploring":Browsing_the_various_modules.html the various provided "modules":Index_of_modules.html and examples ! Additionally, you may want to read a bit more about the Git workflow, specifically how to update your local copy with the fixes and enhancements done on the Jamoma Git repository.
