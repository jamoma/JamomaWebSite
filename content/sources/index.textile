h2. Source code

The "Jamoma umbrella repository":http://github.com/jamoma/Jamoma/ is hosted at GitHub.

h2. Using GIT

We are using GIT for versioning control. A number of GUI clients are available, as listed on the "GIT web site":http://git-scm.com/.

For an in-depth introduction to using Git with the Terminal, we recomment the book _Pro Git_ by Scott Chacon, available "online and as a free download":http://git-scm.com/book.
