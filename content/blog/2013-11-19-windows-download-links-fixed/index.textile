Minicello has been kind to point out that the links for two of the older versions of Jamoma installers for Windows are broken. This is now fixed.

And while at it: We would very much like to have development of Jamoma for Windows up and running again. If you have some knowledge and experience with C++ development for Windows and some spare time, you are more than welcome to join the development team!
