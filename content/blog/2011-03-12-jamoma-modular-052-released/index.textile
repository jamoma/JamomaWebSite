We are happy to announce that Jamoma Modular 0.5.2 for Mac is now released. Please visit "Jamoma download page":http://jamoma.org/download to grab a copy of the installer. A lot of work has been done since the last release (dating back to "June 2010":/groups/jamoma/weblog/aa50a/Jamoma_Modular_051_RC8_available_to_download.html): "new":https://github.com/jamoma/JamomaModular/commit/c2471ebeb67c5ed505377bd4f43302983ae535e0 "features":https://github.com/jamoma/JamomaModular/commit/7019ff1bada4a93bf53b123346ca88cc9a776f8b, "bug":https://github.com/jamoma/JamomaModular/commit/658f10bd72bb1a3ed335f27f34f07eb16bcab5c4 "fixes":https://github.com/jamoma/JamomaModular/commit/f298983df19366c40df4c97c1124c8ef86fec37d from a list too long to be "detailed here":https://github.com/jamoma/JamomaModular/tree/0.5.2.rc1. We hope you enjoy this new step.

We are unfortunately not able to propose a Windows release at this time because of the lack of developers involved in this platform. If you want to help testing, developing and building installers for Windows, please "get in touch":/forum/ with Jamoma members.

As usual, thanks for your support and feedback.
