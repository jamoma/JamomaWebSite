First thing first, we wish all Jamoma users a happy new year! We hope 2013 will be full of exciting and successful projects!

In order to start 2013 in a good way, we thought it would be great to take the opportunity of the Christmas break to work on the Jamoma website. And "quite a lot of work has been done":https://github.com/jamoma/JamomaWebSite/graphs/commit-activity. The look might be more or less the same, but the website has moved to a different platform - the nice "nanoc web publishing system":http://nanoc.stoneship.org. The motivation for this change is that it will be much easier to feed new content to jamoma.org. So hopefully, this will bring a more life to the website.

We also reorganized the various areas of the website. Worth noting is the "news" section where you now find the Jamoma blog. All posts have been migrated from the old blog system. Be sure to update your bookmarks! There are also new possibilities for joining in the discussion with comments, and sharing content on Facebook or Twitter. In addition might also want to subscribe to the rss feed or to our -monthly- whenever newsletter.

The "Jamoma presentation section":http://www.jamoma.org/core/index.html also see some changes and we will be further improving this over the coming weeks. You will notice that we added a project section: please feel free to "send us a mail":jamoma@jamoma.org or drop a message on the "forum":http://www.jamoma.org/forum/index.html if you have a nice project you would like to share with other Jamoma users.

"Tutorials on Jamoma":/tutorials/ have been added as well. From now on it will be much easier to add and extend tutorials, and hopefully this will make the rich possibilties that Jamoma offers more accessible. If you have particular wishes for topics that you would like to see tutorials on, please let us know, either in the comment fields or by "sending us a mail":mailto:jamoma.org.

We hope you will enjoy the new website. There may be some rough edges here and there, so feel free to contact us if you notice anything unexpected.

Of course, development-wise, quite a lot has happened since the previous post here at the Jamoma blog. We will keep you up to date pretty soon.

In the mean time, best wishes.
