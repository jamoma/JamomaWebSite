Everyone that has been doing a bit of coding, know that syntax highlighting is extremely useful. In order to simplify manual editing of Jamoma cue scripts, I've just added a OSC "TextMate":http://macromates.com/ bundle to the "Documentation":https://github.com/jamoma/JamomaDoc repository.

If you want to start using it straight away, you can download it here:

*UPDATE:* The TextMate bundle is now included with Jamoma installers for Mac
