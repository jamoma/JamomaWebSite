We posted a new alpha release of Jamoma package for Max in the "download section of the site":http://www.jamoma.org/download/. Release 0.6.0-a42 is likely to be the last before Jamoma fully goes beta and we are quite excited about it !

Quite a "number":http://jamoma.org/blog/2014-03-04-swapping_inlet&outlet_order/ of "changes":http://jamoma.org/blog/2014-03-04-Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes/ happened since we last announced a release here, so be sure to give it a test and "let us know":http://jamoma.org/forum/ what you think !

While Jamoma 0.6 has been used in a number of projects so far, please remember that this is still an alpha version, so please fully test your work before using it in a production.
