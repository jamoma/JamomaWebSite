Tim yesterday moved the Jamoma repository from CVS to "Subversion":http://subversion.tigris.org/. We have updated the "Jamoma wiki":http://groupware.bek.no/groups/jamoma/wiki/ to reflect the current changes.

One of many advantages of using Subversion is that you can now get (checkout) Jamoma from the repository with no username/password required.
