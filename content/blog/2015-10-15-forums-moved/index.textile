We have recently moved the forums from SourceForge to Google Groups. The web site has been updated accordingly, and now embeds the "developer forum":http://jamoma.org/forum-developers/ and "user forum":http://jamoma.org/forum-developers/.

For anyone needing to access the old archives, they can still be found here:

* "Archive for the old developer list":https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/jamoma-devel
* "Archive for the old user list":https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/jamoma-users
