Jamoma v.0.3.1 has been uploaded. This version includes universal binaries of all externals, compatible with the public beta universal binary version of Max (Max .4.6). Also included is a number of new modules for work on ambisonics are added, several new video modules, etc.

For further details check the change log below.

h2. Change Log

h3. Version 0.3.1 (23 June 2006)

* Core/Hub/Gui:
** Many tweaks and fixes to the OSC namespace implementation
** fixed problems with initialization of psto caused by receiving bangs at loadbang time rather than init time
** made the implementation of "View internal components" consistent across all modules
** preview item in the module menu is no longer on by default in video modules
** module communication now happens using dedicated sends and receives rather than listening to global broadcasts
* Externals:
** Mac versions compiled as Universal Binary for Max 4.6
** updated Jasch/ICST 3rd party externals
** jmod.saturation has a new 'mode' parameter that changes the algorithm it uses internally
** bug fix for jmod.change where it would filter messages that it shouldn't have
** fixed erratic behavior in jmod.xfade~ on windows
** fixed bug in jmod.oscroute, jmod.change, and jmod.equals where the inlet calls were not thread safe
* Modules:
** new ambisonic modules: jmod.ambi.speaker.delay~, jmod.ambi.doppler~, jmod.sur.multi.in~, jmod.sur.multi.out~, jmod.sur.speaker.setup
** cuelist module now builds a menu with all cues; format for specifying cues in the textfile has changed; comment handling improved
** new jmod.midiin module for midi input
** various improvements to the jmod.mapper module
** new jmod.mouse module for handling mouse input
** new jmod.input% module provides video input from a device or a quicktime movie.
** new jmod.output% module creates a rendering context for Jitter OpenGL patches
** new jmod.xfade% module crossfades between two video sources
** a series of "new" video filters that wrap Jitter externals (ported to Jamoma from Jade): jmod.plur%, jmod.avg4%, jmod.emboss%, jmod.fluoride%
** added randomness parameter to jmod.qmetro
** new sample-accurate jmod.delay~ and jmod.scope~ modules ported from Jade
** jmod.echo~ module now has filtering and limiting built into the feedback loop
** new jmod.phidgets module for working with Phidgets devices
* components:
** new jmod.autocrop% automatically crops source material
** jmod.jsui_multigain.js acts as a visualizer/multislider/gain controller (used in ambisonic modules)
** added jmod.thru which does nothing :-)
** added a series of components for various trigonometric conversions

* Documentation:
** jmod.hub is better documented
** cleaned up all of the help patches
** examples are now fully implemented in the OSC namespace
** pluggo example now works with menu selections
** tutorials split into 2 tracks: "Using Jamoma" and "Making Jamoma Modules"
* Misc:
** added  the 'j3' skin as an example for how to make your own skins for modules
** skin graphics now handled as 'knob' type by pictslider so that the graphic sizes could be reduced by half.


h3. Version 0.3 (9 April 2006)

* Jamoma now uses OpenSoundControl for communication. All modules have been updated accordingly. 
* Added templates for creating various kinds of modules and algorithms.
* Modules now automatically resize their containers (bpatcher frame or window dimensions) when loaded
* Hub/Gui Changes:
** Module size can now be queried using the /getmodulesize message, returning e.g. /modulesize 1U-half. 
** @library_type attribute renamed to @algorithm_type.  This attribute also uses more intelligent defaults based on the module_type that is specified.
** The @options attribute has been eliminated.  In its place, we are now using more precise @module_type attributes with class-like nomenclature.  For example:
** audio
** audio.no_panel
** audio.ambisonic
** control
** video
** video.gl (not implemented, but reserved for future usage)
** Added @inspector attribute.  If 1 it will add an inspector button to the upper-right corner of the gui.  The default is 0.  To use an inspector in your module you must define this, then capture the message from the second outlet of jmod.hub to open your custom inspector window.
** jmod.gui now sports panels dedicated for ambisonic and video modules (not just audio modules).  The video panel provides a more immediate interface for previewing, bypassing, muting, and freezing video output from a module.  
* Added new folder for 3rd part libraries and externals
** Added zipped version of 3rd part GNU LGPL externals made by jasch/ICST (http://www.icst.net/downloads/) in new folder /library/externals_3rd_part:
** ambiencode~: Ambisonic encoding
** ambidecode~: Ambisonic decoding
** Added ttblue library (http://sourceforge.net/projects/ttblue). Used for compiling jmod.limiter~ and jmod.saturation~.
* Documentation:
** Change log is now a separate rich text format file.
** Further work on JIG, both to reflect the change to OpenSoundControl, and to provide more details. Removed some restrictions that are no longer required. 
** Added a new overview patch
** New example added from the Teatrix workshop @ BEK
** New example added that re-generates all HTML for the modules using scripting
* Externals: 
** jmod.oscroute: new external for Routing of OpenSoundControl messages. 
** jmod.equals: new external for comparing symbols 
** jmod.sum%: new external sums the pixels in a Jitter matrix and returns the center of gravity for them
** Several audio externals moved from blue to being Jamoma-native, and renamed accordingly. 
** On Mac OSX platform all externals are now compiled as Mach-O using Xcode 
** jmod.pass has implemented several new features for dealing with messages starting with a "/", required when passing and routing OSC messages. 
** jmod.bridge has been incorporated into jmod.hub and no longer exists.  This have some important implications: jmod.bridge is no longer required in main patches. Instead it is required to provide an unique OSC-compatible name (starting with "/") for each module. 
* New components: 
** jmod.autoscale.mxt ** autoscaling of control values 
** jmod.filewatcher ** used for opening files and watching them for changes in external editors
** jmod.filesaver ** a standardized abstraction for throwing a file dialog and managing consecutive saves
** jmod.return ** returns data from a module (the opposite of jmod.message); accepts many attributes that are in common with jmod.parameter and jmod.message.  This should be used for things like analysis results or flagging when a soundfile is done playing, etc.
* New ambisonic modules:
** jmod.ambi.encodeM~: Encode up to 16 mono ambisonic sources
** jmod.ambi.decode~: Decode 1st ** 3rd order ambisonic signals for up to 16 loudspeakers.
* New audio modules: 
** jmod.saturation~-mod: Stereo saturation 
** jmod.noisegate~.mod: Stereo noise gate. 
** jmod.noisegateM~.mod: Mono noise gate 
** jmod.echo~.mod: Stereo echo module
* New control modules (and algorithms):
** jmod.mappings: create relationships between module parameters, returns, and messages
** jmod.oscnet: send and receive OpenSoundControl messages over a network 
** jmod.hi: module for using human interface devices (game controllers, tablets, etc.)
** New jmod.transformation.alg: can be used to manipulate the data in mappings.
* New video modules:
** jmod.brcosa%.mod: change brigthness, contrast, saturation and b/w 
** jmod.motion%.mod: calculating motion based on simple frame difference 
** jmod.orsize%.mod: change orientation and size of incoming matrices 
* Bug fixes in modules (and algorithms)
** Increased reliability in the calls to jmod.init from the jmod.contro module.
** Implemented new WAIT command in jmod.cuelist.mod. 
** jmod.limi~ renamed to jmod.limiter~
* Bug fixes to components
** jmod.message now uses @clipmode none as the default rather than @clipmode both
** Fixed bug in jmod.line 
** Fixed bug in jmod.cuelist.mod. Can still be developed further for elegancy, functions and efficiency. Maybe for 0.4. 
** Fixed bug in jmod.filter~.mod.
