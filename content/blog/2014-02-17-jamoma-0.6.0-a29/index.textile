A new 29th alpha release of Jamoma 0.6.0 is online. This version contains many improvements relative to the j.parameter|message|return|remote Array externals.

But why should you try the 0.6 version ? because you'll get the benefit of a real Model-View-Controler architecture. Look at those 2 patchers :

p=. <%= fancyImage @item, "images/example-of-MVC-benefit.png", "images/example-of-MVC-benefit.png", "example of MVC benefit" %>

One to patch some sharable and modular ressources and one to patch a specific behavior remotely.

If you're interested in testing the new 0.6.0-a29 release you can get it "here":http://www.jamoma.org/download/0.6/.
