"v001":http://001.vade.info/ is a simple and elegant framework for building modular and reusable performance patches for Max/MSP and Jitter

The lowest level patches in v.001 are abstractions that encapsulate the funcionality of the most commonly used Max/MSP GUI objects (and associated helper patches), rolled into one easy to use bpatcher system of GUI widgets that can be redefined dynamically in performance.

The higher level v.001 framework integrates the functionality to even higher levels of abstraction and ease of use.

v.001 also includes an open source realtime video performance application written in Max/MSP and Jitter, using the v.001 framework and modules (not yet available).

v001 is developed by Anton Marini (aka Vade) and licensed as Creative Common Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
