During the Jamoma development workshop last week, the development team got invited to the "Matralab":http://matralab.hexagram.ca/ at Concordia University in Montr√©al directed by "Sandeep Bhagwati":http://matralab.hexagram.ca/matrapeople/sandeep-bhagwati who holds the Canada Research Chair for Inter-X Art. In his work, Sandeep explores the artistic world between composed, predetermined structures and free improvisation. An approach which he calls "comprovisation". We discussed how Jamoma together with the "Virage":http://www.plateforme-virage.org/ sequencer could be used for comprovisation. We also listened to some spatialization work by "Navid Navab":http://matralab.hexagram.ca/matrapeople/navid-navab which was carried out with the help of Jamoma. It is always exciting to see (and hear) how Jamoma get used.
