"UBC Max/MSP/Jitter Toolbox":http://www.opusonemusic.net/muset/toolbox.html is a modular approach to a standardised way of developing modules in MaxMSP somewhat resembling Jamoma. The UBC Max/MSP/Jitter Toolbox is a collection of modules for creating and processing audio in Max/MSP and manipulating video and 3D graphics using Jitter. Alexander has briefly tested it, and have posted "some screenshots":http://www.arj.no/blog/2006/02/22/ubc-maxmspjitter-toolbox/ from one of the example patches.

UBC Max/MSP/Jitter Toolbox is developed by among others Keith Hamel, Bob Pritchard, and Nancy Nisbet.
