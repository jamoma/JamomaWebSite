It turned out that a few externals where missing in the rc3 installer (jcom.clip~, jamoma~ and jamoma≈), so we try again. We've added those files, but apart from that there are no changes.

Grab the installer from the "download page":/download/.

If you also use TapTools, be sure to install "the latest beta":http://74objects.com/taptools4/.

If you experience any problems with this installer, please report, either in the comment field for this post or via the "forums and mailing lists":/forum/.
