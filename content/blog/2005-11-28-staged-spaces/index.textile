The media installation *Staged Spaces* by "Karen Kiphoff":http://home.snafu.de/%7Ekakidami/ and "Trond Lossius":http://www.bek.no/%7Elossius is currently on display at "Bergen kunsthall":http://www.kunsthall.no as part of the exhibition *Tracing Spaces*. The exhibition also features works by Doris Frohnapfel, Dan Mihaltianu og "Jeremy Welsh":http://homepage.mac.com/jeremyjwelsh/iblog/B1659270737/.

"Staged Spaces" consists of video projection, sound and a physical object. The video is composited in real-time in Max/Jitter on a PC Shuttle, using OpenGL and the improved possibilities of jitter 1.5 to optimize video processing by using the graphical processing unit. Audio is a 9 speaker semi-circular ambisonic setup running from a mini-mac. Jamoma is used on both computers.

*Traced Spaces* is open until December 20.
