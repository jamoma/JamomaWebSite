Over the past spring we have done major under-the-hood changes to how C++ projects are maintained in Jamoma. Instead of needing to maintain parallel Xcode and Visual Studio projects (and potential additional projects for iOS and Linux), we now maintin project using simple YAML text files.

Tim has just posted on how this is done "on his blog":http://74objects.com/2012/07/25/inventing-a-new-project-format/. It is well worth a read, for Jamoma developers as well as others that might be looking for a simple cross-platform project maintenance solution.
