"Joseph Malloch":http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~mallochj/ recently created a new mapping module based on his "DOT Mapper":http://www.idmil.org/software/mappingtools.

_The DOT mapper is a network-based peer-to-peer mapping network and associated GUI, built for digital musical instrument mapping in the IDMIL at McGill University.__

In addition to Jamoma's jmod.mapper, jmod.mapperContinuous and jmod.mapperDiscrete this module offers an alternative way of creating mappings.

Beside other cool things, Joe's module can create mappings within Jamoma, but also to environments outside the Jamoma world.
