Yesterday we were notified that a paper on "Jamoma":http://www.jamoma.org was accepted for "ICMC 2008":http://www.google.no/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.icmc2008.net%2F&ei=lEYlSKHnH5SWwAH2xqyMCg&usg=AFQjCNFiLd9mkoNXmx7f_QBb3UegfY4Lwg&sig2=R1RYu0qIhN7WxYz8WQrYLg. We will also have a paper on the OSC namespace used for Jamoma presented at "NIME 2008":http://www.google.no/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fnime2008.casapaganini.org%2F&ei=qUYlSOWxO4bgwgHx5oGJCg&usg=AFQjCNHyRunYOO8aMwuaRLeOMVmsysgRiQ&sig2=oo83KyqQlah5V9VFN-Gcfg.

In addition there will be a panel session at ICMC entitled "Towards an interchange format for spatial audio scenes" set up by Gary Kendall, Nils Peters and Matthias Geier. SpatDIF - Spatial Sound Description Interchange Format, proposed by Nils Peters, has been developed in close relation to Jamoma development, with Jamoma being the primary test platform for implementation.
