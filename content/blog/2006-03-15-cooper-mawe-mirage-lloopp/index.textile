Here are some more environments for MaxMSP modules more or less related to the philospphy of Jamoma. I have not had the time to check out of all them yet to see how they compare to Jamoma:

"Cooper":http://www.maximilianmarcoll.de/COOPER.html is a flexible environment which can be controlled from meta-parameter-levels without loosing direct control of single parameters or giving responsibility to the computer. The idea was to create a flexible environment which can be controlled from meta-parameter-levels without loosing direct control of single parameters or giving responsibility to the computer. The audio processing is encapsulated into modules, which get connetcted through a matrix.

"MaWe":http://www.cyf-kr.edu.pl/%7Ezbcholon/mch/mainframes.html has been designed as a compositional and performance tool for audio and video purposes.

"mirage":http://www.incidentsmemorables.org/mirage/ is a software written in a Max environment, initially conceived for sounds and recently equiped with powerful tools to treat images (Jitter, SoftVNS, etc.).

"lloopp":http://lloopp.klingt.org/start.html is a software written in max/msp, designed for live-improvising on a macintosh.
