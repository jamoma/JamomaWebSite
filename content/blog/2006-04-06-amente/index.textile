"aMente":http://faculty.roosevelt.edu/malone/ru/downloads.htm by prof. Don Malone is an algorithmic generator, a compositional tool in the studio, can be played in real time like an instrument, and works by applying various patterns to musical parameters (Rhythm - Pitch - Velocity - Duration - Voice). The player controlls the patterns. The patterns may be preconstructed themes or various serial and chaotic processes. aMente is useful as a composition tool or performance instrument. Manipulate a theme, range or set in real time, improvising with theories.
