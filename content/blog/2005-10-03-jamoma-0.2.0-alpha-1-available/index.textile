The first pre-release of Jamoma (version 0.2 alpha 1) is now available for download form the front page. We have not yet made proper installers, but installing should be as easy as downloading the Mac OSX or Windows XP version, unpack and copy or move to the Cycling'74 folder.

In addition you might want to look for the jmod.meter\~ external and copy that to the max-startup folder.
