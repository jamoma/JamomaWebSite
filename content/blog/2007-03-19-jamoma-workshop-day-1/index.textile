"GMEA":http://www.gmea.net is holding a 4 day workshop on Jamoma, set up by Pascal Baltazar. We'll try to blog what happens as it happens.

The first day of the workshop starts of with a presentation by Tim Place, discussing general philosophy of Jamoma, how it has evolved, and the modular structure of layers of complexity, from the C++ layer used for externals, including the ttblue framework, via components, algorithms, modules to a not existing top layer providing a framwork hosting Jamoma modules.
