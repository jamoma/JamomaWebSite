"Theater Max":http://remap.ucla.edu/audio/theatermax is a collection of patches (abstractions, really) for control of sound in a performance environment, its usefulnessis certainly not limited to theater. Theater Max is broken down into three main components: cue list patches, cue properties patches, and the playbank patch.

Theater Max got its start in 2001 with a production of Eugene Ionesco's Macbett. This was the first production in UCLA's Theater Department to incorporate interactive technology into a mainstream theater production. It is made by David Beaudry & Jonathan Snipes, and licensed as GNU GPL.

**Update:** If you don't get through to the Theater Max site using the link above, try "this one":http://128.97.152.24/audio/theatermax/ instead.
