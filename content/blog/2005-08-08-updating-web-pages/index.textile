I'm currently in the middle of updating the web pages, so that jamoma.org can have its own look and feel instead of inheriting the look of the BEK intranet. There's a few issues about integration of Zope and Plone still to be sorted out, and consequencially the WIKI is not loading properly at the moment. I've posted a temporary copy of the wiki "here":http://www.bek.no/Members/lossius/jamoma_wiki. The copy will be removed once everything works properly again, hopefully by the end of the week
