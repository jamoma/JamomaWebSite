p(lead). The Jamoma website has just had a total makeover, and we hope that it will be a lot easier to find the information you need from now on.

Getting to the downloads should be straight-forward, and we have improved the descriptions of "Jamoma for Max":/max/ and the "Jamoma C++ libraries":/cplusplus/. Additionally "Jamoma for PureData":/pd/ is starting to make a presence at the site.  In the near future we will expand the site further with a set of screencasts on how to use Jamoma with Max. We believe that Jamoma is pretty awesome, and hopefully the new website helps making Jamoma more accessible to the community.

If you discover any issue on the new site, please leave a comment for us here so that we can fix it. Thanks!
