Jamoma 0.5.4.rc1 (release candidate 1) has been "uploaded":/download/. All issues related to OSX Lion are believed to be solved. There are no major changes as compared to the previous beta 2 release. Still, please give it a try. If we do not hear any complaints, this will be released as 0.5.4 the coming weekend.
