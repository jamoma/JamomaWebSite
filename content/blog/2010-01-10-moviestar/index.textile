"Moviestar":http://moviestar.marieke.nu/ is an interactive installation by Marieke Verbiesen & Neeltje Sprengers.

The installation moulds old and new media together in order to create a reallife moving filmset. Classic 16mm film, animation, robotics, sound and motion-tracking are used to simulate a real life film set where visitors play the main role.

A miniature robotic film set forms the background for the movie, while interactive animations come are activated once a visitor enters the film set.

In front of a green screen on the other side of the space, the visitors movements are tracked in real time, both sound and image respond their movements. Projected into a world that consists of monsters, UFOÂ´s and other slightly surreal events, visitors can control animations by by moving in front of the camera. Jamoma, "cv.jit":http://www.iamas.ac.jp/~jovan02/cv/ and "FTM":http://ftm.ircam.fr were used for live video analysis, processing and control.

Moviestar was presented at Filmhuis Den Haag September - October 2009.
