I've continued work on the layout of the blog. It's a fairly labourous
work, but I believe most of it is done now. It seems to be a problem
about posting comments at the moment, but that's the only remaining
issue that i know of. If you discover anything else, please mail me
(lossius at bek dot no).

The commenting problem seems to be related to plone issues that are
still to be resolved, and the reason why the WIKI is down at the moment.
