jmod.cuelist.mod is a new module implementing event cues in Jamoma in a simple text format, in a similar way to the event script in "Jade":http://www.electrotap.com/jade/. In conjunction with jmod.bridge, a new Jamoma component added today as well, it can control several or all Jamoma modules.

Cue scripts can be saved and recalled as text files. The module is watching for changes to the loaded cue script file, so that an external text editor can be used to edit the cue script while working in Max/Jamoma. Furthermore jmod.cuelist can request current state of all modules, and display it in a simple text format for copy, paste and edit into the cue list text file.
