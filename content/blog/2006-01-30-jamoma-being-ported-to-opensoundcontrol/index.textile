It has been decided that we are going to move Jamoma to use the OpenSoundControl protocol for communication between and within modules. At current the CVS is in a bit of a mess as it is undergoing the transition. If there are any "bleeding edgers" out there, here's a detailed techy note on what have been accomplished so far (this list will be updated as the transition progress):

* New external: **jmod.oscroute**
* routing of OSC messages.
* Changes to **jmod.pass** external
* Updated the core of Jamoma (components, etc.)
* All audio modules except **jmod.output\~.mod** are now ported and should work properly (including algorithms, presets, help files amd html documentation)
* All control modules are updated. **jmod.cuelist** might undergo further changes.
* All video modules are now ported.

**Last update**: February 19.
