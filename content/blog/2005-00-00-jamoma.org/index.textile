"jamoma.org":http://www.jamoma.org is now up and running. The site is hosted by "BEK":http://www.bek.no. The site might look dull at the moment, mainly inheriting standard intranet layout solutions from BEK, but hopefully this will gradually be customized. The BEK servers offers a number of powerful services for us to take advantage of, including plone, zope, various streaming possibilities, blog, wiki, CVS, mailing lists, tracker, chat, etc. etc.
