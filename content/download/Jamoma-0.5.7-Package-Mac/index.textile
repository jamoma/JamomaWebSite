Thanks for downloading Jamoma! Your download should start automatically. If you experience problems with the download, please try this "direct link":attachments/Jamoma-0.5.7-Package.zip.

Max 6.1 introduce a "new solution for distribution of 3rd party externals as packages":http://cycling74.com/2013/03/11/max-6-feature-packages/. The zipped folder that you are now downloading is a hand-crafted reorganisation of the content of the 0.5.7 installer as a package for the 32-bit version of Max 6.1 and higher. If you want to use this, you first need to run the regular installer ("download here":/download/Jamoma-0.5.7-Mac/). Afterwards download and unzip this package, and move it to your @Max 6.1/packages@ folder.

Further details on this release can be found in "this blog post":/blog/2013-04-07-jamoma-0-5-7-package/.
