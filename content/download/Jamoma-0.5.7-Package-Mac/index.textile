Max 6.1 introduced Packages for 3rd party externals. The zipped folder that you are now downloading is a reorganisation of the content of the 0.5.7 installer as a set of packages for the 32-bit version of Max 6.1 and higher. If you want to use this, you need to:
  
# Run the regular installer, "found here":/download/Jamoma-0.5.7-Mac/.
# Download and unzip this package. In the unzipped folder you'll find two folders.
# Move the @Jamoma-0.5.7@ folder to your <code>~/Documents/Max/Packages</code> folder.
# Additionally, in order to install 3rd party JamomaDependencies externals, move the folders inside the @Jamoma-Dependencies@ folder to the <code>~/Documents/Max/Packages</code> folder.
