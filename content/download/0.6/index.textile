h3. About Jamoma 0.6

Jamoma 0.6 will be introducing major changes to how Jamoma Modules are structured, introducing true model-view-controller separation. An introduction to Jamoma 0.6 is provided as a patcher you can find into the package inside the examples folder (see in "Modular0.6_overview").
