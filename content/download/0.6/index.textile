h3. About Jamoma 0.6


Jamoma 0.6 is introducing major changes to how Jamoma Modules are structured, introducing true model-view-controller paradigm. 

The video below presents the main features of the way Jamoma 0.6 works, and can help getting an idea of it.

(Please notice that this video has been made a while ago, and that most jamoma objects names have changed since them, though their features remained mostly identical)

An introduction to Jamoma 0.6 is also provided as a patcher that lays in the installation package inside the examples folder (see in "Modular0.6_overview").

Please notice that all modules developed using Jamoma 0.5 will need to be updated in order to work with Jamoma 0.6.
